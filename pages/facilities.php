                <p>Bến Tre Province is located in southern Vietnam in the heart of the Mekong Delta. Ben Tre is comprised of eight districts spread across three main inslands and an eponymous capital city. The province is located directly between two branches of the Mekong River. Only 1.25 meters above sea level on average, Bến Tre province is likely to be severely impacted by rising sea levels.</p>
                <p>Agriculture is a main industry in Bến Tre province. Along with rice, coconuts are the major crop in the region. Bến Tre (nicknamed “Land of the Coconut”) is home to nearly 36,000 hectares of coconut woods that yield 242 million coconuts per year. The coconut tree, known as the tree of thousands of uses, has spiritual and material significance for the Vietnamese people. The trunk is used for timber, the husk shell can be used to make charcoal, and the leaves are used to make ropes. Both coconut water and flesh are an integral part of Vietnamese cuisine, and are used to make the famous coconut candies. Coconut trees also provide a valuable environmental service, with their extensive root systems stabilizing the soil to minimize erosion.</p>
