                <h3>Facilities</h3>
  				<p>The program is based in Palazzo Santacroce, a facility that is second to none. Ample studio space, a library, a materials shop, and tech support are all housed in a spectacular 17th-century villa. On-site program staff with decades of experience ensure an unparalleled degree of personal care and attention to students’ needs. </p>
                <p>The palazzo was originally constructed for the Santacroce family who held various titles of nobility and produced four cardinals, one of whom introduced tobacco from Portugal to Rome, where it was called "erba santacroce" and was attributed with therapeutic properties. Palazzo Santacroce was designed and constructed under the direction of three architects: Carlo Maderno, the celebrated architect of the façade and nave of San Pietro in Vaticano (1598–1602); Francesco Peparelli (1630–40), and Giovanni Antonio De Rossi (1659–72).</p>

                <h3>Undergraduate Student Housing</h3>
  				<p>Cornell in Rome provides furnished and well-maintained apartments of varying sizes in popular neighborhoods of Rome. Distributed throughout the Centro Storico (historic city center) and Trastevere in characteristic Roman apartment buildings that date from the late 1800s and early 1900s, these apartments give students the opportunity to experience typical Italian neighborhoods, as well as the chance to discover all the best places for pasta, pastries, and gelato. All apartments are located within a five- to 20-minute walk from classes and studio spaces at the Palazzo Santacroce and are close to public transportation.</p>
                <p>Each apartment is completely furnished with kitchen equipment and utensils, laundry equipment, linens, blankets, and pillows, and is regularly checked throughout the semester by program staff members to ensure that everything remains in good working order.</p>
