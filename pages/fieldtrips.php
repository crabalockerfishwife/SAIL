        <p>A hugely important element of this course is the service learning component. Students will have the opportunity to experience life and the hardships of the Mekong Delta, particularly as a result of drought and climate change. Highlighted below are a few of the field trips that the Winter 2017 course had the opportunity to embark on.</p>

			<div class="panel">

                <p>Can Gio (Cần Giờ) Biosphere Reserve is located in the coastal district southeast of Ho Chi Minh City.  It covers 75,740 hectares and is dominated by mangroves, including both salt water and brackish water species.  Brackish water species are organisms that originate from areas where freshwater and salt water meet, which allows them to tolerate a wide range of salinities.  A mangrove is a tree or shrub that grows primarily in tropical coastal swamps that are flooded at high tide.  Mangroves grow in coastal saline or brackish water.  They typically have numerous tangled roots above ground that form dense thickets.  Mangroves range in size from small bushes to trees around 60 meters (200 feet).  Within a mangrove forest, different species thrive and occupy distinct niches. The mangrove forest at Cần Giờ holds many valuable ecological functions, such as coastal stabilization and protection against coastal erosion, oil spills and storm surges.  In addition, it provides a site for tourism, public education, scientific research, and training.</p>
                <p>On January 5th, the Winter 2017 students had the opportunity to visit Cần Giờ, plant mangroves, and explore a bat sanctuary - only accessible via speedboat. As such, both the students and teachers found themselves piled onto two very small boats in order to properly observe and experience the bat sanctuary -- a memory that will never be forgotten by the students.</p>
                <p>After visiting the sanctuaries, the group then proceeded back onto speed boats to travel to the nearby crocodile swamp. Imagine actually getting into the swamp via a caged boat and having the opportunity to then feed the live crocodiles with pieces of eel tied to sticks. At times, the studnets recall at least five crocodiles at the base of their feet.  The noise that they make when they jumped up and grabbed the eel was unforgettable.</p>

			<button class="accordion">Ben Tre Farm: Lending a Helping Hand</button>
			<div class="panel">
  				<img src="../images/mekongfarm.jpg" alt='Mekong Farm Trip'>
                <p>Bến Tre Province is located in southern Vietnam in the heart of the Mekong Delta. Ben Tre is comprised of eight districts spread across three main inslands and an eponymous capital city. The province is located directly between two branches of the Mekong River. Only 1.25 meters above sea level on average, Bến Tre province is likely to be severely impacted by rising sea levels.</p>
                <p>Agriculture is a main industry in Bến Tre province. Along with rice, coconuts are the major crop in the region. Bến Tre (nicknamed “Land of the Coconut”) is home to nearly 36,000 hectares of coconut woods that yield 242 million coconuts per year. The coconut tree, known as the tree of thousands of uses, has spiritual and material significance for the Vietnamese people. The trunk is used for timber, the husk shell can be used to make charcoal, and the leaves are used to make ropes. Both coconut water and flesh are an integral part of Vietnamese cuisine, and are used to make the famous coconut candies. Coconut trees also provide a valuable environmental service, with their extensive root systems stabilizing the soil to minimize erosion.</p>
                <p>The students had ample opportunity to actually contribute to work done on a local farm in the Mekong Delta.  The group rotated between jobs including hoeing, planting, harvesting plants, and getting in tiny canals to pick up clay from under the water and putt it below plants.  According to the students, the last task was particularly exciting; students actually went barefoot into Mekong water, picked up clay under the water with their bare hands and spread it out over dirt.  Needless to say, the students were extremely dirty by the end of their day on the farm, but equally as exciting to be able to tangibly help out.</p>

			<button class="accordion">Local Farming: Installing a VACB System (Vuon, Ao, Chnong, Biogas)</button>
			<div class="panel">
  				<img src="../images/vacbsystem.jpg" alt='VACB System Installation'>
                <p>The group started at Can Tho University’s fourth campus (about an hour from downtown) for a lecture on the development of the Mekong and how a VACB Biogas system works.  A VACB Biogas system stands for Vuon, Ao, Chnong, Biogas or orchard, pond, pig pen, biogas.  This sustainable system takes manure from a pig pen, puts it in a giant tank to decompose, and spits out methane (natural gas) for use in the kitchen and as nutrients for orchard soil.  It’s a perfect invention for pig pen and orchard bearing families in the Mekong Delta.  Students traveled to a local farm and, with help from other Vietnamese university students, actually constructed a VACB units for a local family.  The other university students helped out significantly, showing us how to build the tanks (many layers of plastic bags and pipes), leveling out our messy job of digging a hole, and just overall being huge motivators during the process.  Their enthusiasm to volunteer for this local family demonstrated the local culture’s huge respect and appreciation for one another.  They weren’t just volunteering for themselves, they were volunteering to improve the livelihoods of their neighbors, and it genuinely was reflected in the work they were doing.</p>
